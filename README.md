Meteor-Webrtcio
===============

This is a test, trying to get webRTC.io to work in Meteor

Files of Interest
=================

packages/webrtcio/webrtc.io.js - this file I hard coded in the new Websocket port on line 149 to 4040

packages/webrtcio/meteor-webrtcio.js - I have the ws server listening to port 4040

Everything else is just webRTC.io's demo placed into Meteor

###Get the project running

- clone the repo

- cd into directory 

- then run `meteor --release 0.6.0`
